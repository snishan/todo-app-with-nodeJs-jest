# Todo Application with Node.js, MongoDB, and Jest Testing

This is a simple Todo application built using Node.js and MongoDB. The app allows users to create, update, delete, and view tasks. It demonstrates how to set up and write unit tests using Jest to ensure the functionality of the backend API endpoints.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: 
  - Create a new Todo
  - Read all Todos
  - Update a Todo
  - Delete a Todo
- **MongoDB**: All data is stored in MongoDB for persistence.
- **Testing with Jest**: Unit tests are written for each of the API endpoints to ensure that the application logic works as expected.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or a MongoDB cloud instance (e.g., [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
